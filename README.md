# Required Task 
Wuxus app assignment
Implement an app which consists of 3 views:
1) A list of posts, where the user can either add a new post or click on a post and be sent to the post view.
2) A post view where the user can see the entire post + comments. The user can go back to the list. Optionally a delete post option can be added.
3) An add post view where the user can add a post.

**Note:**
> -  You should only make an app on the platform relevant to your skillset and the position for which you are applying.
> -  Should use a network library (For IOS: Alamofire or other.)
> -  Use RESTful API from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/1
o Only get results from the user with the userId 1 and the relevant
comments.
